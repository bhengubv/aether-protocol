## [1.0.1] — 2026-05-21

### Fixed
- `ITransportService.ts` now exports `PerTransportMetrics` and `rankTransports`
  (were missing, causing all `transport_rank.test.ts` tests to fail at import)
- `InProcessTransport` now implements `metrics: PerTransportMetrics` and records
  a sample on each successful delivery (fixes `transport_inprocess.test.ts`
  metrics assertions)
- `PROTOCOL_SPEC.md` `SosPriority` corrected from `999` to `255` (byte overflow)
- `PROTOCOL_SPEC.md` `DefaultChunkSizeBytes` corrected from `262144` to `8192`
  (mesh-correct value matching all runtime implementations)

## [1.0.0] — 2026-05-21

First stable release. All eight language implementations (C#, Kotlin, Swift,
Rust, TypeScript, Go, Python, C) are wire-compatible and publish to their
respective package registries from a single CI/CD pipeline.

### Added

**Core protocol**
- AODV-based mesh routing with Kalman-filtered transport selection
  (`PredictiveTransportSelector`)
- RREQ deduplication with TTL-based eviction
  (`DeduplicationWindowSeconds = 300`) — closes replay-DoS vector
- Signal Protocol Double Ratchet end-to-end encryption for all peer messaging
- Minimum packet length enforced at 43 bytes in both C# and TypeScript
  deserialisers (was incorrectly 31)

**Services**
- `IStreamingService` — live broadcast, segment publishing, ABR bandwidth
  estimation, active-stream enumeration
- `IWatchTogetherService` — watch-party hosting/joining, play/pause/seek/speed
  sync, live emoji reactions, BitTorrent broadcast, ChipIn crowdfunding
- `IVideoCallService` / `IGroupVideoService` — 1-to-1 and multi-party video
  with automatic FullMesh → SFU topology switch
- `IVoiceCallService` / `IGroupVoiceCallService` — audio-only calls and
  group voice rooms
- `IContentService` — chunked P2P file distribution with hash verification
  and chunk reassembly
- `IDtnService` — store-and-forward bundle delivery for offline peers
- `IMessagingService` — Signal-encrypted direct messaging with outbox retry;
  zero-plaintext-persistence security guarantee
- `IReputationGossipService` — peer reputation scoring gossiped across mesh
- `IAnomalyDetector` — traffic-pattern anomaly detection
- `ISosBroadcastService` — priority-255 emergency broadcast interrupting all
  lower-priority traffic
- `IHandshakeService` — peer capability negotiation on connect
- `IRoutingService` — AODV route discovery and maintenance
- `ITransportManager` — pluggable transport layer (BLE, Wi-Fi Direct,
  NearLink, NFC, LoRa, HTTP relay)

**Extensibility**
- `IAetherMeshAiProvider` — AI integration point (route suggestion, transport
  biasing, threat assessment); null-provider contract guarantees safe
  unconditional call on all methods
- `NullAetherMeshAiProvider` — canonical reference implementation; allocation-free
  on hot path
- `IAetherMeshIncentiveProvider` — node-tipping / relay-incentive hook
- `IAetherMeshBackendClient` — optional cloud-relay fallback

**Identity**
- `AetherMeshTag` — human-readable Ed25519-derived identifiers (e.g. `KXJB7-MN2P4`)
- UHID-based routing; all packets signed to source UHID

**Android companions** (Blue / Green / White)
- `AetherMeshGattServer` — BLE GATT server with companion-object packet parsing
  and TTL decrement; 23 JVM unit tests
- `AetherMeshWifiDirectService` — Wi-Fi Direct transport with companion-object
  framing; 19 JVM unit tests
- `AetherMeshHceService` — NFC HCE with companion-object AID recognition; 18
  JVM unit tests

**Infrastructure**
- Full CI across all 8 languages on every push to `main` / `develop`
- Coverlet coverage gate (80%) with exclusions for generated code and
  `[ExcludeFromCodeCoverage]` attributes
- Rust MSRV job (`1.75`) in CI
- Go module verification (`go mod verify`) in CI
- Benchmark regression gate — C# and Rust baselines enforced; failures are
  hard errors (exit 1)
- Source Link + deterministic builds; symbol packages (`.snupkg`)
- Single-command publish to all 8 registries on semver tag

**Documentation**
- Architecture overview, transport layer deep-dive, getting-started guide
- `SECURITY.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, `VERSIONING.md`

### Fixed

- RREQ replay-DoS: dedup cache previously evicted on size; now uses TTL
- Messaging outbox retry incorrectly incremented retry counter for
  zero-length (awaiting-session) messages, causing silent `Failed` state
- `catch {}` swallowing `OutOfMemoryException` in `PacketSerializer` — now
  `catch (Exception ex) when (ex is not OutOfMemoryException)`
- Minimum packet length constant corrected to 43 bytes in C# and TypeScript

### Changed

- `DefaultChunkSizeBytes`: spec corrected to `8192` (8 KB) — matches runtime;
  previous spec value of `262144` was copied from a TCP context and wrong for
  BLE/mesh transports
- `SosPriority`: spec corrected to `255` — matches runtime; previous spec
  value of `999` overflows a single byte
